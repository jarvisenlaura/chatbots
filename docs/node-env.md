# Project setup

## Install code editor

* [Download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* ...or skip this step and use JavaScript editor of your choice.

## Setup development environment

* Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code server-side. 
* Install Node.js to your laptop by [downloading the installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and running it after download is completed.
* When installation is complete, open Terminal (Mac) / Command Prompt (Windows) and verify that node works ok. Type 'node --version' and confirm that node version number is printed out.

```
$ node --version
v9.9.0
```

## Download project template

* Download [project template](https://github.com/lauravuo/node-project-template/archive/master.zip) (set of source code you can start working on).
* Unzip the downloaded folder to location of your choice. Rename folder 'node-project-template-master' to something more descriptive e.g. 'lunchbot'.
* Open Visual Studio Code and open the folder (File -> Open).

## Check that you can build and run the code

* Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code (View -> Integrated Terminal)
